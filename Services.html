		<b>What makes QFO unique?</b>
	</h2>
	<p>Quick fix orthodontics uses a technique new to the orthodontics world. As soon
	as the teeth that are being corrected have finished moving, we imediatly tighten
	the braces again. In conventional orthodontics, the teeth are allowed to set 
	before moving them. However, this takes far longer than at quick fix orthodontics.
	Even the most damaged smiles can be repaired within two months! So come to QFO 
	to be welcomed with warm smiles and you'll be leaving with a warm smile of your
	own before you know it. </p>
